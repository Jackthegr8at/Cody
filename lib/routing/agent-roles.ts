/**
 * Making subagents resolve through omp's ROLES instead of hardcoded model
 * names.
 *
 * The failure this prevents, traced through omp 18.1
 * (`config/model-resolver.ts` `resolveEffectiveAgentModelSelection` and
 * `task/structured-subagent.ts`):
 *
 * - An agent definition may pin a concrete model
 *   (`~/.omp/agent/agents/luna.md` → `model: openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna`).
 * - `resolveAgentModelSelection` returns `role: undefined` for any source
 *   that is not a role alias. The role is what keys the child's inherited
 *   retry-fallback chain — so a concrete pin means the subagent gets **no
 *   fallback chain at all**, however carefully `retry.fallbackChains.task`
 *   was written.
 * - If the pinned pattern matches nothing in the live catalog, the
 *   resolution falls through to `activeModelPattern` — the PARENT's model.
 *   Ask an Opus session for a cheap subagent and you get Opus, silently, on
 *   every spawn.
 * - An agent with no `model:` at all (scout, security-reviewer) takes that
 *   same parent-model path by definition. The bundled reviewer declares
 *   `model: "@slow"` (omp 18.2), and an override must keep that role rather
 *   than trade it for a cheaper one.
 *
 * `task.agentModelOverrides` outranks agent frontmatter, and a role alias
 * (`@task`, `@smol`, …) restores both properties at once: the role's
 * fallback chain is inherited, and the concrete model is resolved from
 * `modelRoles` — which the role binder keeps pointed at a provider that can
 * actually answer. So the override is written as an ALIAS, never as a model.
 *
 * Cody only ever fills a gap or repairs a pin it can prove is broken. An
 * override the user wrote themselves is left exactly as found.
