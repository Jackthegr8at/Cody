/**
 * Ordering accounts the way the user was told they are ordered.
 *
 * Two Cody surfaces name the same account: Settings numbers a provider's
 * accounts by omp's credential row id (creation order — stable, and unmoved
 * by an account being disabled or hitting a limit), while the composer's
 * quota popup names them "Primary"/"Secondary" from the usage snapshot. But
 * `omp usage --json` lists reporting accounts first and appends disabled
 * tombstones after them, so the moment a primary account's token expired the
 * two surfaces disagreed outright: Settings called it Primary, the composer
 * called it Secondary and promoted the sibling.
 *
 * So the credential store is authoritative for ORDER on both surfaces. Only
 * disabled accounts carry their row id in the usage payload; the active ones
 * are matched here, by engine account id first and email second (an account
 * id never collides, an email can be reused across providers), which is the
 * same join `lib/omp/provider-login.ts` makes for state.
 *
 * Failure is not an error: an account that cannot be matched keeps
 * `credentialId: null` and sorts after every identified one, in the order the
 * engine reported it. That is exactly the pre-enrichment behaviour, so a
 * missing or unreadable credential store degrades to what shipped before
 * rather than reshuffling anything.

 *
 * omp records a block against the credential (`auth_credential_blocks`) when
 * a provider answers with a limit, and refuses to send on that credential
 * until it expires. The usage API is a different source and does not know
 * about it — measured on this machine: an Anthropic account reporting **4%
 * used** was blocked until 03:20Z, so the composer ring showed plenty of
 * headroom while every turn fell back to another provider. Same for the
 * Token Plan key, blocked for six days while its plan reported fine.
 *
 * A block is therefore folded in as an exhausted, untiered window on the
 * account: the ring shows it, `resolveModelAvailability` reports the model
 * exhausted, the blackout registry remembers it until `blockedUntil`, and
 * the role binder routes around it. One source of truth means the blocks
 * have to be IN it.
