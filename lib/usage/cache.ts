 * and adds one helper spawn per cache refresh, not per request; a failure
 * leaves the engine's own ordering exactly as it was.
 *
 * Providers the ENGINE cannot report are merged in here, so every consumer
 * — ring, popup, availability, routing — keeps reading exactly one snapshot.
 * Alibaba's Token Plan is the first: omp has no usage provider for it, but
 * the plan itself reports a 5-hour and a weekly window through Alibaba's
 * own CLI (see alibaba-usage.ts). Its absence is carried as a REASON rather
 * than silence, so the UI can offer to connect it instead of showing a gap.
