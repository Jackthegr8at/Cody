/**
 * Where Cody finds the OpenRouter key(s) to read the account with.
 *
 * Three stores hold one, and they are NOT interchangeable — the order below is
 * the order the engine itself resolves in, so what Cody reports is what the
 * running agent actually spends:
 *
 *   1. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` saved in Cody (`cody-provider-keys.json`), which
 *      `engineChildEnv` injects into every engine child. A key typed into
 *      Settings wins, because it is the most recent deliberate choice.
 *   2. The same variable set on the container.
 *   3. omp's OWN credential store. This is the one that matters in practice:
 *      `omp /login openrouter` writes an `api_key` credential into
 *      `<agentDir>/agent.db`, and a user who signed in that way has NO
 *      environment variable anywhere. Reading only the environment would show
 *      "no key configured" to someone whose sessions are billing OpenRouter
 *      right now.
 *
 * The management key is separate and Cody-only (`OPENROUTER_MANAGEMENT_KEY`):
 * omp has no concept of it, it is never handed to an engine child, and it
 * exists purely so the activity and key-management reads can work. Keeping it
 * out of `engineChildEnv` is deliberate — a provisioning-scoped credential has
 * no business being in an agent's environment where its own shell tools could
 * read it.
